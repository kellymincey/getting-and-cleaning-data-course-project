# Code Book:

This code book summarizes the data fields in `tidy.txt`.

# IDs (2)

* `subject` - The ID of the test subject
* `activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

## Activity Labels (6)

* `WALKING` (activity ID `1`): subject was walking during the test
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS` (activity ID `2`): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` (activity ID `3`): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* `SITTING` (activity ID `4`): subject was sitting during the test
* `STANDING` (activity ID `5`): subject was standing during the test
* `LAYING` (activity ID `6`): subject was laying down during the test
